#View



##What is view doing?

- The responsibility of the view is to deal with UI logic. 

- In context of web the goal for view is to produce a response to the user (the browser not the human).

- Views are implemented as code snippets, not as classes. This is because views are typically very simple and contain only the mixture of HTML and inline PHP code.
