#Controller



##How use alias

It's also possible to use the alias (short name for the class) with the help of PHPâ€™s use statement:

	!php
	use Zend\Mvc\Controller\AbstractActionController;

Although the alias allows to use a short class name instead of the full name, its usage is optional. You are not required to always use aliases, and can refer the class by its full name.
